# Robot_Arm_Controller_GUI
Code for Elizabethtown College Class of 2022 Articulated Robotic Arm Control GUI. This is to make sure the original code stays available for future students.
The GUI was implemented using the tkinter lib provided with python. The code does have issues, but will have updated comments to explain if there is an issue 
that is known, and also to provide future students to the understanding need to create and implement their own GUI. It is not easy starting from nothing, so feel
to use my programming as a starting place. I do not recommend trying to improve upon my code but use in in the implementation of you own code. There will 
be links to the tutorials that I will provide as a user guide for my GUI. This code is considered open source. Refer to the licensing information.

Note: You will find bugs in this code. It is just meant to be a test platform/starting point for future teams.
