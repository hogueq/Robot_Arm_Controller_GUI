# Robot_Arm_Controller_GUI
Code for Elizabethtown College Class of 2022 Articulated Robotic Arm Control GUI. This is to make sure the original code stays available for future students.
The GUI was implemented using the tkinter lib provided with python. The code does have issues, but will have updated comments to explain if there is an issue 
that is know, and also to provide future students to the understanding need to create and implement there own GUI. It is not easy starting from scrach so feel
to use my programming as a starting place. I do not recommend trying to improve upon my code, but rather use in in the implmentation of you own code. There will 
be links to the tutorals that I will provide as a user guide for my GUI. This code is considered open source.
