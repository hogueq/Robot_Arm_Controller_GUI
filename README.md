# Robot_Arm_Controller_GUI
Code for Elizabethtown College Class of 2022 Articulated Robotic Arm Control GUI. This is to make sure the original code stays available for future students.
The GUI was implemented using the tkinter lib provided with python. The code does have issues, but will have updated comments to explain how the control works. If there is an issue that is known it may have information in the comments of the code. This code also provides future students the understanding need to create and implement their own GUI. If struggling to understand why something is written the way it is please contact the Elizabethtown college engineering department to get in contact with me or make a comment on here for me to find. It is not easy starting from nothing, so feel
to use my programming as a starting place. I do not recommend trying to improve upon my code but use part of it in the implementation of your own code. This code is considered open source. Refer to the licensing information.

Note: You will find bugs in this code. It is meant to be a test platform/starting point for future teams.
